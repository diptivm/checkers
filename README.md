## Rules
(Source: Assignment prompt)
* Each player starts with their pieces lined up on the two rows closest to their own side.
* Players play from opposite ends of the board, and take turns moving pieces diagonally forward from one square to another.
* A turn consists of moving one piece diagonally-forward to an adjacent unoccupied square.
* If one player's piece, the opponent's piece, and an empty square are lined up, then the first player can "jump" the other player's piece. In this case, the first player jumps over the other player's piece onto the empty square and takes the other player's piece off the board. Multiple sequential jumps by one piece are allowed on a single turn.
* If a player's piece moves into the last row on the opposite side, it becomes a king piece, and can now move forward or backward.
* The game ends when a player loses all of their pieces, or is put in a position where they canâ€™t move.
